## Overview

Thanks for checking out my portfolio project. This is a temporary portfolio and i am going to build a new one with react in a couple of month, So let's enjoy it for now! üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Remember that "Every day is a learning day" and try to learn from everyone!

## My process

### Where to find resources

The first think to do is to look for your perfect design! So let's checkout [dribble](https://dribbble.com/) our favourite design to begin!

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript(ES6+)
- SASS
- GSAP
- Bootstrap
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox / CSS Grid
- desktop-first workflow
- WEB3 form

### Clean Code using

- BEM / Conventional commits

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the project. So if you got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a try. However, i wrote this design with simple html5 and css and js and made it responsive for all the devices, since my users should be able to: View the optimal layout and hover or active states depending on their device's screen size

### What I learned

This projects helped me being more familiar with the details of js and how to work with GSAP, and use my scss knowledge as well to create a responsive project with small details on colors,sizes and so on. I used amazing plugins from GSAP and used horiztontal scrolling.
To see parts of my codes and see how you can add code snippets, see below:



```html

     <main class="o-main-container container-fluid m-0 p-0">
          <div class="c-main-title-box position-relative d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
              <h1 class="c-main-title" id="c-main-title">
                  <span class="c-main-title--one">MY</span>
                  <span class="c-main-title--two">PORTFOLIO</span>
              </h1>
              <p class="c-main-job-title mb-0 text-white c-typewriter js-typewriter">My art as a developer!</p>
              <div class="c-scroll c-scroll--heading w-100 d-none d-md-flex align-items-center justify-content-center position-relative">
                <strong class="mr-2 d-inline-block c-scroll-text text-white">Keep scrolling</strong>
                <div class="c-scroll-wrapper">
                  <div class="c-scroller"></div>
                </div>
              </div>
              <img class="img-fluid c-title-img" src="/assets/images/ellefamkar.jpg" alt="Elle Famkar">
          </div>
    </main>

  observer.observe(target);

gsap.to(sections, {

    scrub: 1,
    snap: 1 / (sections.length - 1),
    end: "+=3500",
